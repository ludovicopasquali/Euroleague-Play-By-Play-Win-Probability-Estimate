# Reports

Use this folder for generated figures and tables that support the write-up or presentation. By default, `reports/figures/` and `reports/tables/` are gitignored to avoid committing large artifacts; unignore specific assets if you need them in the repo.

Current outputs (23-24 season run):
- `reports/figures/eda_home_point_diff.png`
- `reports/figures/calibration.png`
- `reports/figures/roc.png`
